## Key Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw sales data for analysis.
- Visualize trends and patterns to support data-driven decisions.
- Identify top-performing products, customers, and regions.

## Workflow Overview

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Applied XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and IF functions to standardize and enrich the dataset.
- Consolidated product details such as Coffee Type and Roast Type into more descriptive categories.
- Removed duplicates and addressed missing data (e.g., blank emails).

2. Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables to display
- Annual sales trends by order dates.
- Sales distribution by coffee roast type and size.
- Segmented views based on loyalty card usage.

3. Data Visualization
- Line Chart: Showcased total sales trends over multiple years.
- Bar Chart: Highlighted: Sales distribution by country and Top 5 customers based on total revenue contribution.

4. Interactive Features
Incorporated Slicers for dynamic filtering based on:
- Roast Type.
- Coffee Size.
- Loyalty Card status

## Key Insights

1. Sales Trends:
- Sales grew significantly in 2021, indicating increased customer demand.
- Medium-roast coffee was consistently popular across all years.

2. Regional Performance:
- The United States was the top-performing country in terms of sales.
- Ireland showed smaller but steady sales, with higher interest in Robusta and larger sizes.

3. Customer Preferences:
- Loyal customers (with loyalty cards) contributed more significantly to overall sales.
- Larger coffee sizes generated higher revenue, despite lower order frequency.

## Limitations
The analysis has several limitations, including incomplete data due to missing email information for some customers, which reduces the ability to track individual purchasing patterns; a small dataset covering limited years and customers, making it less generalizable to larger-scale trends; reliance on manual Excel formulas for data cleaning, which could introduce human error or inefficiencies; and a static analysis approach constrained to Excel, without dynamic integration with real-time data updates.
